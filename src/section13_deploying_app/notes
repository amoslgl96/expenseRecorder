git commands:

git init -> start a repository

git status -> high level overview - provides contextual
info of what files are where 
: like on which branch
: untracked files
: staged files 
: commit files 



we only want git to track the files we wrote ,

files like node_modules , we do not want git to track 
, node_modules can be regenerated via package.json 

to do that we need to create .gitignore file 





git add ...




git commit -m " " 


git log -> shows you your commit history and messages



readme.md file -> contains information you want

    console tools are not used. to save space.

    we need to know how to take out the referenced css files within the bundle,
    and put them in styles folder.
