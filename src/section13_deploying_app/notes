To deploy react app,

1) 
we need to learn how to optimize webpack for production
to create a smaller bundle size.





git commands:

git init -> start a repository

git status -> high level overview - provides contextual
info of what files are where 
: like on which branch
: untracked files
: staged files 
: commit files 



we only want git to track the files we wrote ,

files like node_modules , we do not want git to track 
, node_modules can be regenerated via package.json 

to do that we need to create .gitignore file 





git add ...




git commit -m " " 


git log -> shows you your commit history and messages



readme.md file -> contains information you want 
viewers to see 




For github to communicate with our machine, 
we need establish a secure way of communication to the github server 
we need: 
SSH, secureShell -> 
set up SSH keys 


can communicate via SSH/https I think.
